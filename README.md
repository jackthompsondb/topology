## Background and Introduction

The motivation for all of this came from the following 3Blue1Brown video presenting "The inscribed square/rectangle problem, solved using MÃ¶bius strips and Klein bottles."

I also ventured into my own area of this analysis applied to networks instead of curves.

## Structure

- customfunctions/
    - contains four custom MATLAB functions to do four essential tasks to make the reproduction of the tests easy to piece together
        - "fdistances.m" INPUT: n pairs of coordinates OUTPUT: nxn distance matrix
        - "finterpolate.m" INPUT: n pairs of coordinates, resolution  OUTPUTS: defines the curve at a higher resolution than input curve
        - "fmidpoints." INPUT: n pairs of coordinates, form="Matrix" or "List" OUTPUTS: the midpoints of all pairs in matrix or list form
    - all of above are collated and a base analysis is outputted by "fplot_topology.m" which works for any coordinate pair input

- functiontopologies/
    - contains analysis of shapes generated by functions
  
- networktopologies/
    - contains analysis of networks generated from Laplacian from py/

- polygon_topologies/
    - contains analysis of shapes generated by the coordinate output of the polygon drawn from PDE_modeller application from MATLAB's Partial Differential Equation add-on 

- pde_polygons/
    - contains the direct output code for the shapes generated from the PDE_modeller application
 
- py/
    - contains the python code to generate, test and output information for networks

## Networks

Network construction was done in python, constructed from the following principles:
